# Paper Notes
This repository contains my paper reading notes on deep learning and machine learning. It is inspired by [Denny Britz](https://github.com/dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes) and [Daniel Takeshi](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes).

## About Me
My name is Dat Vu, and I am currently leading the AI Team at [PhenikaaX](https://phenikaa-x.com), a rapidly growing autonomous and industrial robot company where I serve as the Computer Vision Leader. I have a passion for seeking answers to complex questions and take great joy in exploring and deeply understanding mathematical concepts.
