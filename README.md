# Paper Notes
This repository contains my paper reading notes on deep learning and machine learning. It is inspired by [Denny Britz](https://github.com/dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes) and [Daniel Takeshi](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes).

## About Me
My name isÂ Dat Vu. Currently, I am leading AI Team at [PhenikaaX](https://phenikaa-x.com), a growing autonomous and industrial robot company where I am a Computer Vision Leader. I love asking why and answering those questions myself. Exploring and delving deeper into mathematical concepts makes me very happy.
