# [An Application-Driven Conceptualization of Corner Cases for Perception in Highly Automated Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.03678)

_September 2021_

tl;dr: Multi-sensor expansion of previous work on corner cases.

#### Overall impression
An essential task of ML-based perception models are to reliably detect and interpret unusual new and potentially dangerous situations. A complication for the development of corner case detectors is the lack of consistent definitions, terms and corner case descriptions.

Corner cases introduced not only by vision system, but also radar/lidar and sensor fusion. This is an extension from [CC-vision](corner_case_vision_arxiv.md) and [CC-vision (IV version)](corner_case_vision_iv.md).
