# Pitfalls in Python and its libraries

## Python
- Python passes by object. This is quite different from pass by reference and pass by value, as explained in the blog [here](https://robertheaton.com/2014/02/09/pythons-pass-by-object-reference-as-explained-by-philip-k-dick/) and [here](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2012/11/13/is-python-callbyvalue-or-callbyreference-neither/).
- pay attention to the trailing `,`. 
```
>>> a = 1
>>> a
1
>>> a = 1,
>>> a
(1,)
```
