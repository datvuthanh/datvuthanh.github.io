# Paper notes
This repository contains my paper reading notes on deep learning and machine learning. It is inspired by [Denny Britz](https://github.com/dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes) and [Daniel Takeshi](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes). A minimalistic webpage generated with Github io can be found [here](https://patrick-llgc.github.io/Learning-Deep-Learning/).
